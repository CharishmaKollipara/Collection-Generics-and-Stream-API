Question

Insurance Bazaar is developing an online website for showcasing various types of Insurance policies to their customers based on their needs. There are various types of Insurances provided by different insurance agencies. The admin of Insurance Bazaar wants to add different insurance policy names like Max Bupa Health Insurance, SBI Health Insurance, IFFCO Tokio Two Wheeler Insurance and New India Assurance Two Wheeler Insurance to his database with Policy ID as the Tags.


Customers can view the names of all the polices available in Insurance Bazaar based on the type of insurance.


Write a Java program to simulate this scenario. Key (Policy ID) should be an Integer and Value (Insurance policy name) should be a String. The key-value should be sorted based on the key. Use the appropriate Collection to Store all these details and display.


The addPolicyDetails method should add the Policy ID and the Policy name into the appropriate map.

The searchBasedOnPolicyType method should return the list of Insurance policy ID depending on the input provided. This method takes the input as string (Input can be either Health or Two Wheeler).

The signature of the above functions are given as part of code skeleton, do not change the function signature.
